#View framework test suite

The tests for *View* use [MXUnit](http://mxunit.org). As such, you can use any of the MXUnit test running tools such as the Eclipse plugin or Ant test runner to run the tests. Additionally, for convenience, you can run all the tests by making *View* web-accessible and browsing to:

	htt://somedomain/view/tests/

Please report test failures and errors to the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/DominicWatosn/view/issues).
